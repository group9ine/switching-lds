The directory holds 101 plain text files each containing the track data for one
of the individual ants studied in the paper.

The name of each file starts with the colony number (C1 to C3), the size of nest
(small: 35×28 mm or large: 55×44 mm) and the consecutive number of the
individual ant for a colony and nest size.

The ant track-data in each file are organised in three columns:

- Column 1: Time in seconds (absolute time) and is therefore comparable accorss ants.
- Column 2: x-coordinate in mm.
- Column 3: y-coordinate in mm.

The centre of the nest exit is located at $(0.5 x_\mathrm{max}, y_\mathrm{max})$.
